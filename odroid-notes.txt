make the fat partition larger in retrospect to fit larger u-boot
perhaps initrd load modules earlier
finish the install process for regular arch too, skip as appropriate
xorg fb and lightdm for stock 4.9 kernel and u-boot

mainline kernel needs new u-boot
kernel params to make boot visible (force panfrost load quickly)
restarting systemd-networkd, install networkmanager?

firefox drop those dom processes down to keep away from memory

zswap? no

display sleeping issue, maybe solved, copy sysfs edid and put in /lib/firmware/edid/my-monitor.bin, initrd file, kernel arg
